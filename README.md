## Important Note:
Due to unfortunate circumstances, I lost access to my previous GitHub account, which contained my earlier work. This repository is a continuation of my project(s), and I'll be using this new account moving forward.

I am in the process of adding my previous projects here, so you can review my past work as well. 

Please feel free to review the code, and I would be happy to provide any clarification or background on my previous work. I appreciate your understanding!
